YML TO JSON CONVERSATION

The below is the package that needs to be installed for making the conversion
sudo apt-get install python-yaml

After installing the package the below command is used to make the conversion of the file.

python -c 'import sys, yaml, json; json.dump(yaml.load(sys.stdin), sys.stdout, indent=4)' < GpsFilePoints.yml > Output.json

I have run this command in the server but the process is getting killed.
